I am a Perl programmer.  In my spare time I work on these Perl related projects:

 * [Platypus](https://metacpan.org/pod/FFI::Platypus), a foreign function interface for Perl that allows developers to call functions in compiled languages like C, Rust or Go.
   All without having to write any XS.
 * [Alien](https://metacpan.org/pod/Alien), and [Alien-Build](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Alien-Build/lib/Alien/Build/Manual/Alien.pod), a toolkit for creating and using non-Perl depndencies for [CPAN](https://metacpan.org)
 * [Perl Wasm](https://metacpan.org/pod/Wasm), for extending the Perl programming language with WebAssembly.
 * I also wrote a [Perl WebSocket client library](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client), but you should probably use [Mojo::UserAgent](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojo::UserAgent) instead.

For bugs in these projects please open an issue or PR for the corresponding GitHub repository.  If you have questions about these projects, please feel free to contact me:

 * [On the #native channel on irc.perl.org](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.perl.org/#native?nick=mc-guest-?)

I practice kindness-oriented programming so if you are rude or abusive to myself, or other people in any of my projects you will be blocked.

I also have an email address associated with my CPAN user id that you can probably figure out.  Please use it only
as a last resort if one of the other channels is not available as I am not very good at email.
